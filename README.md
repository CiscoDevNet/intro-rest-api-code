## Cisco DevNet Learning Labs: REST API Sample Code

This repository contains the sample code to go along with [Cisco DevNet Learning Labs](https://learninglabs.cisco.com) covering programmability topics.

## About this Sample Code

Contributions are welcome, and we are glad to review changes through pull requests. See [contributing.md](contributing.md) for details.

Within this repository are files and folders covering REST API information.  This table provides details on what each is used for, and which labs they correspond to.  

|  File / Folder  |  Description  | 
|  ---  |  ---  | 
|  [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)  |  Global Python requirements file containing the requirements for **all** labs within this repository.  Each folder also contains a local `requirements.txt` file.  | 
|  [`rest-api/`](rest-api/)  |  Sample code and exercises for the [REST API Fundamentals Learning Labs]() <br> (_Publishing Soon_) | 
|  [`requirements-dev.txt`](requirements-dev.txt)  |  Python requirements file containing requirements only needed if developing new code samples.  | 

> Note: These code samples are also leveraged during DevNet Express for DNA events.  If you are one of these events, your event proctors and hosts will walk you through event setup and verification steps as part of agenda.
